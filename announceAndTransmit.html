<p>
  Once the 2020 census has been completed, the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce will be expected to ANNOUNCE the total populations of each state and the number of representatives each state is due in the next House of Representatives. The President will then TRANSMIT that packet of figures to Congress, as governed by <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href= "https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/2a">2 U.S. Code § 2a</a>. This website explains the historical precedents governing this tradition of ANNOUNCE and TRANSMIT.
</p>
  <p>
  These are the central pillars of the “announce and transmit” tradition:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Since 1950, the public announcement of the apportionment numbers has always occurred on the same day as the transmittal of the numbers to the President.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the last 50 years, the announcement has taken place in a press briefing, typically at the National Press Club or Department of Commerce.
    </li>
    <li>
      In recent history, the White House has transmitted the numbers to Congress within 1 day of its reconvening.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the last 9 decades, the apportionment process has been overseen by 4 Republican and 5 Democratic administrations. All announced the numbers to the public and met the statutory deadlines for transmitting the data to the President and then to Congress.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  </p>
<div class="announceAndTransmit">
    <h2>Announce</h2>
    <p>
      Every 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau counts each person in the United States, fulfilling a duty inscribed by the founders in the Constitution of the United States.

      For nearly a century now, the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce have followed the count by publicly ANNOUNCING the total numbers of persons in each state and the number of representatives each state will have in the next decade's House of Representatives.

  <h3>The Transmissions</h3>
    <p>
      “You will recall,” wrote Jesse Jones, the Secretary of Commerce, to his boss, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “that by the provisions of section 22 of the Decennial Census Act of June 18, 1929, as amended by the Act of April 25, 1940, the President is required to transmit this information to the 77th Congress during the first week of the first regular session." And that is what the President did.
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 8, 1941, Roosevelt (a New York Democrat) transmitted “a statement prepared by the Director of the Census” including the population totals and the number of representatives to which each state was to be entitled based on those figures.
    </p>

    <p>
      President Richard Nixon, a California Republican, did the same thing in 1971. The table he transmitted on 27 January 1971 was “authenticated” by the census director, George H. Brown.
    </p>

    <p>
      The timely and faithful transmission of Census data and calculations is a bipartisan tradition.
    </p>
  <h3>Resilient to Change</h3>
  <p>
    The automatic apportionment system has been steady and reliable, but not unchanging. In fact, it has undergone two significant shifts over its history.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1941, Congress passed H.R. 2665, which announced that the “method of equal proportions” would replace the “method of major fractions” as the basis for translating population totals into allocations of House seats. P.L. 77-291, signed by President Roosevelt, established the “method of equal proportions” as the apportionment algorithm that has been used ever since.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1976, Congress granted the Census Bureau one more month to complete its tabulations before handing over its findings to the President. That extension came as part of P.L. 94-521, signed by President Gerald Ford, as part of a larger revision of the Census Act, Title 13. Since the 1980 census, the Census Bureau has delivered state population results by this new December 31 deadline (nine months after “Census Day” on April 1).
  </p>
  <p>
    While the apportionment algorithm has been amended and the deadline for reporting has been extended, this much has never changed: the Census Bureau calculates and the President transmits in accordance with Congress’s legislated instructions.
