        DECISION ON ADJUSTMENT AND SUBSEQUENT LITIGATION
      </li>
      Date? In June 1991, the Undercount Steering Committee, a Census Bureau group charged with advising the director on adjustment, voted 9-2 to recommend using the adjusted population counts. Following this recommendation, the director herself came out in favor of adjustment. However, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, who oversees the Census Bureau disagreed. The Secretary of Commerce's Special Advisory Panel split, four votes to four. https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Bryant_Oral_History.pdf (Beginning at p.22)

      The Federal District Court decided in favor of the Department of Commerce in April 1993.

        March 20, 1996 SUPREME COURT DECISION
      </li>
      The issue was taken up by the Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the secretary's decision not to adjust the 1990 census counts, but did not rule on either the legality or constitutionality of the use of statistical adjustment in producing the apportionment counts.
